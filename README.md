Bridge [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI sessions to the
[claude-desktop-buddy](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy) BLE
hardware — without going through the Claude desktop app.

The buddy firmware officially pairs with Claude for macOS/Windows. This project
lets you drive the same hardware from a plain terminal running the `claude` CLI,
so your desk pet reacts to CLI sessions: sleeps when idle, gets busy when a
tool call runs, blinks when a permission prompt needs your attention, and lets
you approve or deny right from the stick's buttons.

## How it works

```
claude CLI ──PreToolUse/Stop/etc hooks──▶ Unix socket ──▶ daemon ──BLE NUS──▶ stick
                                                           ▲
                                                           └── tails ~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl
                                                               for tokens & recent messages
```

* **Hooks** (configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`) fire on session lifecycle
  events, tool calls, permission requests, and turn boundaries.
* Each hook is a small Python script that posts the event payload to a local
  **daemon** over a Unix socket.
* The daemon aggregates per-session state (`total` / `running` / `waiting` /
  `tokens` / `entries`) and pushes heartbeat snapshots to the stick over BLE
  Nordic UART Service, speaking the same JSON wire format as the desktop app.
* For permission prompts, the hook **blocks** until the stick's buttons decide
  the outcome, then returns `allow` / `deny` to Claude Code.

See [REFERENCE.md in the buddy firmware repo](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy/blob/main/REFERENCE.md)
for the full wire protocol.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnowWarri0r/cc-buddy-bridge
cd cc-buddy-bridge
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .

# Register hooks into ~/.claude/settings.json (makes a .backup copy first):
.venv/bin/cc-buddy-bridge install

# In another terminal, start the daemon:
.venv/bin/cc-buddy-bridge daemon
```

Then start any `claude` session. The daemon scans for a BLE device advertising
a name starting with `Claude`, connects, and begins pushing state.

To remove the hooks:

```bash
.venv/bin/cc-buddy-bridge uninstall
```

## Requirements

* macOS 12+ / Linux with BlueZ (Windows untested)
* Python 3.11+
* A flashed claude-desktop-buddy device (M5StickC Plus)
* Claude Code CLI

## Signal mapping

| Buddy field       | Source                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `total`           | `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` hooks       |
| `running`         | `UserPromptSubmit` → `Stop` hooks         |
| `waiting`         | `PreToolUse` hook (while decision pending)|
| `prompt`          | `PreToolUse` hook payload                 |
| `msg`             | Derived summary of current state          |
| `entries`         | Last N lines tailed from transcript JSONL |
| `tokens`/`today`  | Sum of `usage.output_tokens` in JSONL     |
| `turn` event      | `Stop` hook + last assistant message      |

## Status

Early. MVP covers heartbeat + permission round-trip. Folder push (streaming GIF
character packs from the CLI) is not implemented yet.
